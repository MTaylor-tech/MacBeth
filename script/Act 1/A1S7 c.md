ACT \[1\]

SCENE \[7\]

(Enter MACBETH)

MACBETH

If it were done when 'tis done, the 'twere well it were done quickly. If the assassination could be the end of the whole business, then it would be easy to leap to that dark event, but there is no knowing if that is going to be the final showing, the final flowing of blood before the butcher's blade. By butchery we only beget butchers who return to bedevil the prime meat-man. Justice, even-handed, forces the poisoner to drink from his own cup. He's here in double trust: First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, so I should protect him. Second, I am his host, and the guest-right commends me to shut out his murderer and prohibits me from bearing the knife myself. Besides, King Duncan has been a good ruler, and his virtue and legacy will speak for him when he dies. I can't spur myself to do the deed, but for my ambition, which pushes me on toward disaster.

(Enter LADY MACBETH)

MACBETH

How now! What news?

LADY MACBETH

He has almost finished his supper. Why have you left the chamber?

MACBETH

Has he asked for me?

LADY MACBETH

You know he has.

MACBETH

We will proceed no further in this business. He has honored me of late, and I have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people, which would be worn now in their newest gloss, not cast aside so soon.

LADY MACBETH

Was the hope drunk wherein you dressed yourself? Has it slept since? And wakes it now, to look so green and pale at what it did so freely? From this time such I account your love. Are you afraid to be the same in your own act and valor as you are in desire? Would you have that which you esteem the ornament of life, and live a coward in your own esteem, letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,' like the poor cat in the adage?

MACBETH

Prithee, peace. I dare do all that may become a man, who dares do more is none.

LADY MACBETH

What beast was it then, that made you break this enterprise to me? When you dared do it, then you were a man; and to be more than what you were, you would be so much more the man. Not time nor place did then adhere, and yet you would make both. They have made themselves, and that their fitness now does unmake you. I have given suck, and know how tender it is to love the babe that milks me. I would, while he was smiling in my face, have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums and dashed his brains out, had I sworn as you have done to this.

MACBETH

What if we should fail?

LADY MACBETH

Fail? Oh, screw your courage to the sticking-place, and we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--where else would his day's hard journey soundly invite him--his two chamberlains will I with wine and wassail so convince that memory, the warder of the brain, shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason a limbeck only. When in swinish sleep their drench√®d natures lie as in death, what cannot you and I perform upon the unguarded Duncan? What not put upon his spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt of our great quell?

MACBETH

(embracing her)

Bring forth men-children only, for your undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males. Will it not be received,

When we have marked with blood those sleepy two

Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,

That they have done it?

LADY MACBETH

Who dares receive it otherwise,

As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar

Upon his death?

MACBETH

I am settled, and bend up

Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.

Away, and mock the time with fairest show.

False face must hide what the false heart doth know.

(Exuent)
