ACT \[1\]

SCENE \[3\]

(Enter WITCHES)

MACHA

Where hast thou been sister?

BADB

Killing swine.

NEMAIN

Sister where thou?

MACHA

A sailor's wife had chestnuts for a snack  
And munched and munched and munched the whole stack.  
"Give me one," was all that I asked.  
"Aroint thee, witch!" she replied with a smack!

NEMAIN

Alack!

BADB

A lack of respect if you ask me.

MACHA

Her husband's gone to Aleppo by sea,  
So, I'll stow aboard as a crow or a flea.

BADB

I'll give thee a wind.

MACHA

Thou'rt kind.

NEMAIN

And I another.

MACHA

I myself have all the other.  
And the very ports they blow,

All the quarters that they know  
Each direction they can go!  
I’ll drain him dry as hay.

Sleep shall neither night nor day

Hang upon his penthouse lid.

He shall live a man forbid.

Weary sev'nnights nine times nine

Shall he dwindle, peak and pine.  
Though his bark cannot be lost,

Yet it shall be tempest-tossed.  


Look what I have.

BADB

Show me! Show me!

MACHA

Here I have a pilot's thumb,  
Wrecked as homeward he did come.

(A drum)

NEMAIN

A drum! A drum!  
MacBeth doth come!

WITCHES

The weird sisters, hand in hand,

Posters of the sea and land,

Thus do go about, about,

Thrice to thine and thrice to mine

And thrice again, to make up nine.

Peace! The charm’s wound up.

(Enter MACBETH and BANQUO)

MACBETH

So foul and fair a day I have not seen.

BANQUO

What are these?  
So withered and so wild in their attire,

That look not like inhabitants of the Earth,

And yet are on it?---Live you? Or are you aught

That man may question?

(WITCHES put their fingers to their lips)

BANQUO

You seem to understand me,

By each at once her choppy finger laying

Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,

And yet your beards forbid me to interpret

That you are so.

MACBETH

Speak, if you can. What are you?

MACHA

All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of Glamis!

BADB

All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!

NEMAIN

All hail, Macbeth, who shall be king hereafter!

BANQUO

Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear

Things that do sound so fair? (to the WITCHES) In the name of truth,

Are ye fantastical, or that indeed

Which outwardly you show? My noble partner

You greet with present grace and great prediction

Of noble having and of royal hope,

That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.

If you can look into the seeds of time

And say which grain will grow and which will not,

Speak, then, to me, who neither begs nor fears

Your favors nor your hate.

MACHA

Hail!

BADB

Hail!

NEMAIN

Hail!

MACHA

Lesser than MacBeth and greater!

BADB

Not so happy, yet much happier!

NEMAIN

Thou shalt father kings, not be one though.

So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!

(WITCHES vanish)

BANQUO

The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,

And these are of them. Whither are they vanished?

MACBETH

Into the air, and what seemed corporal

Melted, as breath into the wind. Would they had stayed.

BANQUO

Were such things here as we do speak about?

Or have we eaten on the insane root

That takes the reason prisoner?

MACBETH

Your children shall be kings.

BANQUO

You shall be king.

MACBETH

And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?

BANQUO

To the selfsame tune and words.

MACBETH

Double double toil and trouble,  
The witches' words within me bubble,  
Boiling over, bringing trouble, double.  
Out of fallen foes and rubble,  
They called me 'Glamis',  
Fine, but they called me 'Cawdor'.  
Why in hell would they call me that for?  
And 'king hereafter'  
I can't control my laughter.  
Duncan alone sits on that throne  
Sworn in on the Stone of Scone,  
The Stone of Destiny  
That means to the rest of the  
Lords and Thanes that addressed to the  
Nation is a True King  
But that's just it, Destiny... Fate... Wyrd...  
Can a man know his fate? Can he  
Escape his future? Can he  
Change the course of Destiny?  
When is it too late  
for a man to debate his fate?

(Enter ROSS)

BANQUO

Who's here?

ROSS

MacBeth, the king hath happily received,

The news of thy success, and when he reads

Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,

He sent me to herald you to his sight,

And for an earnest of a greater honor,

He bade me, from him, call you Thane of Cawdor.

In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,

For it is yours.

BANQUO

What, can the devil speak true?

MACBETH

The thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me

In borrowed robes?

ROSS

The rebel who was the thane lives yet,  
but under heavy judgement his fate is set.

MACBETH

Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!

The greatest is behind. (to ROSS and ANGUS) Thanks for your pains.

(aside to BANQUO) Do you not hope your children shall be kings,

When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me

Promised no less to yours?

BANQUO

That, trusted home,

Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,

Besides the thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange.

And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,

The instruments of darkness tell us truths,

Win us with honest trifles, to betray us

In deepest consequence.

MACBETH

When is it too late  
for a man to debate with his True Fate?  
Rewrite the slate with a new date  
of his rising and falling?  
What happens if I do wait  
to see? Will it be too late?  
Or will I get a new fate?  
If I hesitate will it escalate  
Because of my stalling?  
But do I dare to seize fate?  
To instigate a rising o'er the true state?  
  
If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me without my stir.  
  
But on Duncan's power I salivate.  
Is it my destiny to prostrate  
Myself on his word, his mandate?  
Or do I dare to satiate  
My hate and create what will culminate  
In my need to desecrate, to amputate  
the weak limb from the body of this state?  
To disintegrate the portrait  
To narrate the story of my own Fate  
To Inflate my own fame, to impersonate  
The leader of a new state,   
to dictate and adjudicate  
the pronouncements of these Three Fates,  
To illuminate the new gate  
of a new future I will inseminate?  
I will postulate on my need to retaliate  
Against the fate these witches anticipate.  
I will seize a new Fate  
to debate my True Fate!  
(If) It's not too late!  
  
Come what come may,  
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.

BANQUO

Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.

MACBETH

Give me your favor. My dull brain was wrought

With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains

Are registered where every day I turn

The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.

(aside to BANQUO) Think upon what has chanced, and, at more time,

The interim having weighed it, let us speak

Our free hearts each to other.

BANQUO

Very gladly.

MACBETH

Till then, enough. Come, friends.

(Exeunt)
