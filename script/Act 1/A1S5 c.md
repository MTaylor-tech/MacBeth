ACT \[1\]

SCENE \[5\]

(Enter LADY MACBETH with a letter)

LADY MACBETH

"Upon the heath they spoke to me  
These fateful words, the witches three.  
Called me Cawdor and King-to-Be  
Before the lands of Cawdor were given me.  
This I have thought good to deliver thee,  
My partner of greatness, dearest to me,  
That you might not lose the cause of my levity.  
Keep this secret close to thee.  
My love in word, vow, and deed."  
  
Glamis you are and Cawdor, and shall be  
That high station promised to thee  
If you cast off your natural nicety  
And strike at the first opportunity.  
You've ambition to your credit, I've seen,  
but not the villainous man's depravity  
Without which you can't treat dishonestly  
He whom you must devour hungrily  
In hopes that you might win the seat.  
Hie thee hither, that I may speak to thee,  
In spirits and honey poured so sweet to thee,  
And strike out from you that which impedes  
Thee seizing the chance which Fate would wish to see.  


(enter SERVANT)

  
What news?

SERVANT

The king comes tonight.  


(exit SERVANT)

LADY MACBETH

The monarch flies to my web to be caught!  
Victory approaches. So near!  
Come thou spirits that tend to mortal thought  
Come to me! Unsex me here  
And fill me from the crown to the toe  
Full of all things cruel. Thicken my blood!  
Let no touch of womanly compassion show!  
Take from my breasts my mothers' flood  
You murd'ring ministers, wherever you hide  
In sightless substances wherein you dwell.  
Come shadow me in darkest of night!  
Cover the stars with the smoke of hell  
So my keen knife sees not the wound it will score  
Nor heaven peep out to cry, "Hold! Hold!"  
Great Glamis, worthy Cawdor!  
Greater than both if ye be but bold!  


(Enter MACBETH)

MACBETH

My dearest love,

Duncan comes here tonight.

LADY MACBETH

And when goes hence?

MACBETH

Tomorrow, as he purposes.

LADY MACBETH

O, never

Shall sun that morrow see!

Your face, my thane, is as a book where men

May read strange matters. To beguile the time,

Look like the time. Bear welcome in your eye,

Your hand, your tongue. Look like the innocent flower,

But be the serpent under it. He that’s coming

Must be provided for; and you shall put

This night’s great business into my dispatch,

Which shall to all our nights and days to come

Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

MACBETH

We will speak further.

LADY MACBETH

Only look up clear.

To alter favor ever is to fear.

Leave all the rest to me.

(Exeunt)
