ACT \[1\]

SCENE \[6\]

(Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, BANQUO, MACDUFF, ROSS, and attendants)

DUNCAN

This castle hath a pleasant seat. The air  
Is sweet upon our gentle senses.

(Enter MACBETH and LADY MACBETH)

DUNCAN

Oh, sweet hosts! We are your guests!

LADY MACBETH

And we welcome the honor of hosting you. Our servants and our home are yours to treat as your own.

DUNCAN

(to MACBETH)

Oh, worthiest cousin, the sin of my ingratitude even now was heavy on me. You are so fast to do me service that the swiftest wing of recompense is slow to overtake you. Only I have left to say,

more is your due than more than all can pay.

MACBETH

The service and the loyalty I owe in doing pays itself. Your highness' part is to receive our duties and our duties are to your throne and state.

DUNCAN

My plenteous joys seek to hide themselves in drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes, know we will establish our estate upon our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter the Prince of Cumberland and our heir; which honor must not unaccompanied invest him only, but signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine on all deservers.

MACBETH

(aside)

The Prince of Cumberland! That is a step on which I must fall down, or else o'erleap, for in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires; let not light see my black and deep desires. The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.

(exit MACBETH)

DUNCAN

(finishing an unheard coversation with BANQUO)

True, worthy Banquo. He is so valiant, and in his commendations I am fed. It is a banquet to me.

(turning to LADY MACBETH)

DUNCAN

By your leave, hostess.

(Exuent.)
