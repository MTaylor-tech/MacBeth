ACT \[1\]

SCENE \[2\]

(Enter DUNCAN, ROSS, MALCOLM. MACDUFF from opposite side.)

DUNCAN

What bloody man is that? He can report  
As seemeth by his plight,  
Of the revolt, the newest state.

MALCOLM

It's the sergeant, who like a good soldier  
Fought 'gainst my captivity, set me free.  
Hail brave friend!

ROSS

Tell us now what's been done  
What' transpired in this one  
Tell the king and tell his son  
Is the battle lost or won?

MACDUFF

I did not know. I had my doubt,  
If in the end we could pull it out.  
Merciless, murderous, malfeasant,  
Menace-to-Men MacDonwald  
(Worth to be called a rebel for  
His villainies go on and on.) Well  
From the West is supplied  
With gallowglass and kerns beside.  
It looked like Lady Luck had  
Allied with his clan and all.  
But all's too weak.  
  
Brave MacBeth (he deserves that name well)  
Drew his sword and before him foes fell.  
Like Valor's knight  
he carved a passage with godly might.  
Through the enemy knaves  
Until he faced the slave  
Who ne'er shook hands nor farewell bade  
Until MacBeth unseamed him from the chops to the nave.

DUNCAN

Oh valiant cousin, worthy gent!

MACDUFF

But hark! King of Scotland, hark!  
No sooner had his dying sound  
Convinced the kerns to turn around  
Than fresh troops hit the ground  
And soon we were surrounded. (And soon they did us surround)\[\#option\]

DUNCAN

Did this dismay MacBeth and Banquo?

MACDUFF

In a word, king?... No.  
Point against point! Rebellious arm against arm,  
They curbed his lavish spirit.  
And to conclude, the victory fell on us.  
But I am faint. My gashes cry for help.

DUNCAN

So well your words become you as your wounds.  
They smack of honour both.  
Go get him surgeons.  
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive my bosom interest.  
Go pronounce his present death and with his former title, greet MacBeth.

ROSS

I'll see it done.

(exit MACDUFF, aided by ROSS)

DUNCAN

What he hath lost, noble MacBeth hath won.
