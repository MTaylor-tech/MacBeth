ACT \[2\]

SCENE \[2\]

(Enter LADY MACBETH)

LADY MACBETH

That which has made them drunk has made me bold.

What has quenched them has given me fire.

Hark! Peace! It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman,

Which gives the sternest good-night. He is about it.

The doors are open, and the drunken men

Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugged their drinks,

So much that it's impossible to know

If they're alive or dead.

MACBETH

(within)

Who's there? What, ho!

LADY MACBETH

Oh no! Have they awoken and it is not done?  
I laid their daggers ready; He could not miss them. Had he not resembled my father as he slept, I'd have done it myself.

(Enter MACBETH with bloody daggers)

LADY MACBETH

My husband!

MACBETH

I have done the deed. Did you hear a noise?

LADY MACBETH

I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. Did you not speak?

MACBETH

When?

LADY MACBETH

Now.

MACBETH

As I descended?

LADY MACBETH

Yes.

MACBETH

Wait! Who sleeps in the second chamber?

LADY MACBETH

Donalbain.

MACBETH

(looking at his hands)

This is a sorry sight.

LADY MACBETH

A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.

MACBETH

One in the other room laughed in his sleep, and one cried "Murder!" and they woke each other. I stood and listened, but they said their prayers and returned to sleep.

LADY MACBETH

Malcolm and Donalbain are lodged together.

MACBETH

One cried, "God bless us!" and "Amen" the other, as if they had seen me with these hangman's hands. Listening to their fear, I could not say "Amen," when they said "God bless us!"

LADY MACBETH

Don't consider it so deeply.

MACBETH

But why could I not pronounce "Amen?" I had most need of blessing and "Amen" stuck in my throat.

LADY MACBETH

These deeds must not be thought of in this way. If we do, it will drive us mad.

MACBETH

I thought I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more! MacBeth murders sleep"--the innocent sleep, sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care, the death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, chief nourisher in life's feast.

LADY MACBETH

What do you mean?

MACBETH

Still it cried, "Sleep no more!" to all the house. "Glamis has murdered sleep, and therefore Cawdor shall sleep no more. MacBeth shall sleep no more!"

LADY MACBETH

Who was it that said this? You weaken yourself to think so brainsickly of things. Go get some water and wash this filthy witness from your hands. Why did you bring these daggers from the place? They must lie there. Go carry them and smear the sleeping servants with blood.

MACBETH

I'll go no more. I am afraid to think of what I have done. I dare not look on it again.

LADY MACBETH

Coward! Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead are but as pictures. It's a child's eye that fears a painted devil. If he still bleeds, I'll paint the faces of the servants with the blood, for it must seem their guilt.

(Exit LADY MACBETH. A knock within.)

MACBETH

Whence is that knocking? How is it that every noise appals me? What hands are here? Ah! They pluck out mine eyes. Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my hands? No, these hands will rather the multitudinous seas incarnadine, making the green one red.

(Enter LADY MACBETH)

LADY MACBETH

My hands are of your color, but I shame to wear a heart so white.

(A knock within.)

LADY MACBETH

I hear a knocking at the south entry. Let's reture to our chamber. A little water clears us of this deed. How easy it is, then! Your resolve has left you.

(Another knock.)

LADY MACBETH

Hark! More knocking. Get on your nightgown. Be not lost so poorly in your thoughts.

MACBETH

To know my deed, it were best to not know myself.

(Another knock.)

MACBETH

Wake Duncan with your knocking. I wish you could.

(Exeunt.)
