ACT \[2\]

SCENE \[3\]

(Enter a PORTER. Knocking within.)

PORTER

Here's a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of Hell's gate, he should get tired of turning the key.

(Knocking within.)

PORTER

Knock, knock, knock! Who's there, in the name of Beelzebub? Here's a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty. Come in, gather your towels around you. Here you'll sweat for it.

(More knocking.)

PORTER

Knock, knock! Who's there, in the other devil's name? Faith, here's an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. Oh, come in, equivicator.

(More knocking.)

PORTER

Knock, knock, knock! Who's there? Oh, it's an tailor who skimped on his customers' fabric and pocketed the profits, but can't get away with it now that that's the fashion. Come in, tailor. Here you may roast your goose.

(More knocking.)

PORTER

Knock, knock! Never quiet. What are you? But this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter it no further. I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire.

(Knocking.)

PORTER

Anon, anon! Please remember the porter.

(PORTER opens the gate. Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX.)

MACDUFF

Was it so late, friend porter, before you went to bed, that you lie so late?

PORTER

In truth, sir, we were carousing until the second bell. And drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.

MACDUFF

What three things does drink especially provoke?

PORTER

Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes. It provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore, much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery. It makes him and it mars him. It sets him on and it takes him off. It persuades him and disheartens him. Makes him stand to and not stand to. In conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.

MACDUFF

I believe drink gave you the lie last night.

PORTER

That it did, sir, but I requited him for his lie, and I think, being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, I made a shift to cast him.

MACDUFF

Is your master stirring?

(Enter MACBETH)

MACDUFF

Our knocking has awakened him. Here he comes.

LENNOX

Good morrow, noble sir.

MACBETH

Good morrow, both.

MACDUFF

Is the king stirring, worthy thane?

MACBETH

Not yet.

MACDUFF

He commanded me to call timely on him. I have almost slipped the hour.

MACBETH

I'll bring you to him.

MACDUFF

Thank you.

MACBETH

This is the door.

MACDUFF

I'll make so bold to call on him, for it is my limited service.

(Exit MACDUFF)

LENNOX

Goes the king hence today?

MACBETH

He does. He did appoint so.

LENNOX

The night as been unruly. Where we lay, our chimneyes were blown down and, as the say, lamentings heard in the air, strange screams of death, and prophesying with accents terrible of dire combustion and confused events new hatched to the woeful time. The owls clamored the livelong night. Some say the Earth was feverous and did shake.

MACBETH

It was a rough night.

LENNOX

My young remembrance cannot parallel a fellow to it.

(Enter MACDUFF)

MACDUFF

Oh horror, horror, horror! Tongue and heart cannot conceive nor name thee!

MACBETH & LENNOX

What's the matter?

MACDUFF

Confusion now has made his masterpiece.  
Most sacrilegious murder has broke open  
The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence  
The life of the building!

MACBETH

What's that you say? "The life"?

LENNOX

Mean you His Majesty?

MACDUFF

Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight with a new gorgon. Do not bid me speak. See and then speak yourselves.

(Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX)

MACDUFF

Awake! Awake!  
Ring the alarum bell. Murder and treason!  
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! Awake!  
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,  
And look on death itself! Up, up, and see  
The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!  
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites  
To countenance this horror! Ring the bell!

(The bell rings. Enter LADY MACBETH)

LADY MACBETH

What's the matter  
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley  
The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!

MACDUFF

Oh, gentle lady,  
It's not for you to hear what I can speak;  
The repetition in a woman's ear  
Would murder as it fell.

(Enter BANQUO)

MACDUFF

Oh, Banquo, Banquo!  
Our royal master's murdered!

LADY MACBETH

Woe, alas!  
What, in our house?

BANQUO

Too cruel anywhere.  
MacDuff, I beg you, contradict yourself,  
And say it is not so.

(Enter MACBETH and LENNOX)

MACBETH

Had I but died an hour before this news,  
I'd have lived a bless√®d time, for from this instant  
There's nothing serious in mortality.  
All is but toys. Renown and grace are dead.  
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere dregs  
Are left this vault to brag of.

(Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN)

DONALBAIN

What is amiss?

MACBETH

You are, and do not know it.  
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood  
Is stopped; the very source of it is stopped.

MACDUFF

Your royal father's murdered.

MALCOLM

By whom?

LENNOX

His own manservants, as it seemed, had done it.  
Their hands and faces were all badged with blood.  
So were their daggers, which unwiped we found  
Upon their pillows. They stared, and were distracted.  
No man's life was to be trusted with them.

MACBETH

Oh, yet I do repent me of my fury  
That I did kill them.

MACDUFF

Why did you do so?

MACBETH

Who can be wise, amazed, temperate, and furious,  
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man.  
The expedition of my violent love  
Outran the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,  
His silver skin laced with his golden blood,  
And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature  
For ruin's wasteful entrance; there, the murderers,  
Steeped in the colors of their trade, their daggers  
Unmannerly breeched with gore. Who could refrain,  
That had a heart to love, and in that heart  
Courage to make his love known?

LADY MACBETH

(fainting)

Help me hence, oh!

MACDUFF

Look to the lady.

MALCOLM

(aside to DONALBAIN)

Why do we hold our tongues,  
that most may claim this argument for ours?

DONALBAIN

(aside to MALCOLM)

What should be spoken here, where our fate,  
Hiding in wait for us, may rush and seize us?  
Let's run away. Our tears are not yet brewed.

MALCOLM

(aside to DONALBAIN)

Nor our strong sorrow  
Upon the foot of motion.

BANQUO

Look to the lady.

(Exit LADY MACBETH, attended.)

BANQUO

And when we have dressed, let us meet  
And question this most bloody piece of work  
To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us.  
In the great hand of God I stand, and thence  
Against the undivulged pretense I fight  
Of treasonous malice.

MACDUFF

And so do I.

ALL

So all.

MACBETH

Let's quickly put on manly readiness,  
And meet in the hall together.

ALL

Yes.

(Exeunt ALL except MALCOLM and DONALBAIN)

MALCOLM

What will you do? Let's not stay here with them.  
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office  
Which the false man does easy. I'll go to England.

DONALBAIN

I'll go to Ireland. Our separation  
Will keep us both the safer. Where we are  
There are daggers in men's smiles. The near in blood,  
The nearer bloody.

MALCOLM

This murderous shaft that's been shot  
Has not yet fallen, and our safest way  
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse,  
And let us not be hesitant to leave,  
But steal away. There's warrant in that theft  
Which steals itself when there's no mercy left.

(Exeunt.)
