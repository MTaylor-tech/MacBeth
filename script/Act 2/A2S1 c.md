ACT \[2\]

SCENE \[1\]

(Enter BANQUO and FLEANCE with a torch or lantern)

BANQUO

How goes the night, boy?

FLEANCE

The moon is down. I have not heard the clock.

BANQUO

And she goes down at twelve?

FLEANCE

I think 'tis later, sir.

BANQUO

I am tired, and yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers,

Restrain in me the cursèd thoughts that nature

Gives way to in repose.

(Enter MACBETH and SERVANT)

BANQUO

Who goes there?

MACBETH

A friend.

BANQUO

What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's asleep.  
He has been in unusual pleasure, and

Sent forth great largess to your offices.

This diamond he greets your wife withal.

(He hands MACBETH the diamond)

MACBETH

Being unprepared,

Our will became the servant to defect,

Which else should free have wrought.

BANQUO

All’s well.

I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:

To you they have showed some truth.

MACBETH

I think not of them.  
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,

We would spend it in some words upon that business,

If you would grant the time.

BANQUO

At your leisure.

MACBETH

If you shall stick by my side, when the time comes,

It shall make honor for you.

BANQUO

If I lose no honor in seeking that honor, I shall.

MACBETH

Rest easy the while, then.

BANQUO

Thanks, sir. The like to you.

(Exuent BANQUO, FLEANCE)

MACBETH

(to the SERVANT)

Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,

She strike upon the bell, then get to bed.

(Exit SERVANT)

MACBETH

Is this a dagger I see before me?  
My whole damnable future laid out for me?  
A ghostly vision meant to allure me?  
Or as true as this steel blade enduring?  
A haunting calling to me imploring  
Me to grasp it thus ensuring  
The direction that I will be exploring?  
I am Fortune's slave adoring  
Praying she'll be to me rewarding  
The scribes of future's past recording  
The annals of my deeds according  
To me as I am lording  
Over Destiny's ship boarding  
For a future that's now forming  
For me?  
  
It's not too late  
To debate my fate  
Elevate to a new state.  
Don't hesitate! Illuminate  
the gate that leads to a new fate.  
Not too late  
Not too late  
  
Now o'er the half-world all seems dead  
And wicked dreams abuse sleeping head  
Those witches in their craft celebrate  
With off'rings to the goddess Hecate,  
And withered Murder alarmed by his dog

Strides through the night and the ghostly fog.  
While I threaten, while I fret, Duncan lives.  
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.  


(A bell)

I go, The bell invites me  
And it is done, so mote it be.  
Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell,  
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.

(Exit MACBETH)
