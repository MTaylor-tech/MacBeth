ACT \[2\]

SCENE \[4\]

(Enter ROSS with an OLD MAN)

OLD MAN

Seventy years I can remember well.  
Within the volume of which time I have seen  
Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night  
Has trifled former knowings.

ROSS

Ha, good father,  
You see that the heavens, as troubled with man's act,  
Threaten his bloody stage. By the clock, it's day,  
And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp.  
Is it night's predominance or the day's shame  
That darkness does the face of Earth entomb  
When living light should kiss it?

OLD MAN

It's unnatural,  
Even like the foul murder. On Tuesday last,  
A falcon, towering in her place of pride,  
Was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed.

ROSS

And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--  
Beauteous and swift, paragons of their race,  
Turned wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,  
Contending against obedience, as if to  
Make war with mankind.

OLD MAN

It's said they ate each other.

ROSS

They did so, to the amazement of my eyes  
That looked upon it. Here comes the good MacDuff.

(Enter MACDUFF)

ROSS

How goes the world, sir, now?

MACDUFF

Why? See you not?

ROSS

Is it known who did this more than bloody deed?

MACDUFF

Those that MacBeth has slain.

ROSS

Alas, the day!  
What good could they pretend?

MACDUFF

They were paid to do it.  
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,  
Are stolen away and fled, which puts upon them  
Suspicion of the deed.

ROSS

Against nature still!  
Thriftless ambition, that will devour  
Their own lives' means! Then it's most likely  
That the crown will fall upon MacBeth.

MACDUFF

He is already named and gone to Scone  
To receive it.

ROSS

Where is Duncan's body?

MACDUFF

Carried to Iona,  
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,  
and guardians of their bones.

ROSS

Will you go to Scone?

MACDUFF

No, cousin, I'm off to Fife.

ROSS

I will go to see the coronation.

MACDUFF

May you see things well done there. Adieu,  
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!

(MACDUFF exits.)

ROSS

Farewell, father.

OLD MAN

God's blessings go with you and with those  
That would make good of bad and friends of foes.

(Exeunt.)
