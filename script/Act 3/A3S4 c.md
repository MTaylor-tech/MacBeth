ACT \[3\]

SCENE \[4\]

(Banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH, ROSS, LENNOX, LORDS, and attendants.)

MACBETH

At first and last, the hearty welcome.

(The LORDS sit.)

LORDS

Thanks to your majesty.

MACBETH

I will mingle with all of you and play the humble host. Our hostess will remain seated, but in due time we will have her bid you welcome.

LADY MACBETH

Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends, for my heart says they are welcome.

(FIRST MURDERER at the door.)

MACBETH

See, they respond to you with their hearts' thanks. Both sides are even. Here I'll sit, in the middle.  
Be large in mirth. Anon we’ll drink a measure

The table round.

(Aside to MURDERER)

MACBETH

There's blood upon your face.

FIRST MURDERER

It's Banquo's then.

MACBETH

It's better on your face than in his heart.  
Is he dispatched?

FIRST MURDERER

My lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him.

MACBETH

You are the best of cutthroats.  
But he's good who did the same to Fleance.  
If you did both, you are without equal.

FIRST MURDERER

Most royal sir, Fleance escaped.

MACBETH

Then I am ill again. Else I'd been whole.  
Now I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in  
By all these doubts and fears--But Banquo's safe?

FIRST MURDERER

Yes, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he rests  
With twenty trenchèd gashes in his head.  
The least a death to nature.

MACBETH

Thanks for that. Get thee gone.  
Tomorrow we'll hear ourselves again.

(Exit MURDERER)

LADY MACBETH

My royal lord,  
You have not said the toast.

MACBETH

Sweet remembrancer.  
Now, good digestion wait on appetite,  
And health on both!

LENNOX

May it please your highness, sit.

(Enter GHOST OF BANQUO and sits in MACBETH's seat.)

MACBETH

Even if we had all Scottish nobles  
Here present, wish we would have Banquo, too.  
Here's hoping he is late for fashion, and  
In no ways due to mischance.

ROSS

His absence, sir,  
Lays blame upon his promise.  
If it please your highness,  
Grace us with your royal company.

MACBETH

The table's full.

LENNOX

Here is a place reserved, sir.

MACBETH

Where?

LENNOX

Here, my good lord. What's wrong, your highness?

MACBETH

Which of you has done this?

LORDS

What, my good lord?

MACBETH

You cannot say I did it. Never shake  
Your gory locks at me.

ROSS

Gentlemen, rise. His highness is not well.

LADY MACBETH

Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus  
And has been from his youth.  
Please, stay seated.  
This fit is momentary; upon a thought  
He will be well again. If much you make of it  
You will offend him and extend his passion.  
Eat and regard him not.

(To MACBETH)

Are you a man?

MACBETH

Yes, and a bold one, that dares look on that  
Which might appall the devil.

LADY MACBETH

Oh proper stuff!  
This is just an illusion of your fear.  
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said  
Led you to Duncan. Oh these mad outbursts,  
Imposters to true fear, would well become  
A woman's story at a winter's fire.  
Shame itself! Why do you make such faces?  
When all's done, you look but on a stool!

MACBETH

No, no! Look there! Behold! Look!  
You! What say you?  
Why, what care I? If you can nod, speak too!  
If charnel houses and our graves must send  
Those that we bury back, our monuments  
Should just have open doors.

(Exit GHOST)

LADY MACBETH

What, quited unmanned in folly?

MACBETH

If I stand here, I saw him.

LADY MACBETH

Fie! For shame!

MACBETH

Blood has been shed ere now, in the olden time,  
Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal.  
Yes, and since too, murders have been performed  
Too terrible for the ear. The time has been  
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,  
And there he'd end. But now they rise again  
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns  
And push us from our stools. This is more strange  
Than such a murder is.

LADY MACBETH

My worthy lord,  
Your noble friends do lack you.

MACBETH

I do forget.  
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.  
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing  
To those that know me. Come, love and health to all.  
Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine. Fill full!

(Enter the GHOST OF BANQUO)

MACBETH

I drink to the health and joy of the whole table.  
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.  
Wish he were here! To all and him we drink,  
And all to all!

LORDS

Our duties and the pledge!

MACBETH

Go! Out of my sight! Let the earth hide you.  
Your bones are marrowless; your blood is cold.  
You have no sentience in those eyes  
With which you glare at me!

LADY MACBETH

Good lords, Think of this  
But as a strange habit. It is not other;  
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.

MACBETH

What men dare, I dare.  
Come at me like the rugged Russian bear,  
The armed rhinoceros, or the Persian tiger;  
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves  
Would never tremble. Or be alive again,  
And dare me to the desert with your sword.  
If trembling I inhabit then, then call me  
The baby of a girl. Out, horrible shadow!  
Unreal mockery, out!

(Exit GHOST)

Why so, being gone,  
I am a man again. Please, remain still.

LADY MACBETH

You have displaced the mirth; and ruined the dinner  
With your strange disorder.

MACBETH

Can such things be,  
And overcome us like a simmer's cloud,  
Without our special wonder? You make me strange  
Even to the disposition that I owe,  
When now I think you can behold such sights  
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,  
When mine is blanched with fear.

ROSS

What sights, my lord?

LADY MACBETH

Please, speak not. He grows worse and worse,  
Questioning maddens him. At once, good night.  
Stand not upon the order of your going,  
But go at once.

LENNOX

Good night, and better health  
Attend his majesty!

LADY MACBETH

A kind good night to all!

(Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH)

MACBETH

It will have blood, they say. Blood will have blood.  
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak.  
Augurs and mystics have by signs  
Made by magpies and crows brought forth  
The secretest man of blood--What time is it?

LADY MACBETH

Almost the morning.

MACBETH

What is it that MacDuff refuses to come  
At my great bidding?

LADY MACBETH

Did you send for him, sir?

MACBETH

I hear it by the way, but I will send.  
There's not a one of them but in his house  
I keep a servant paid. I will go tomorrow  
To the weird sisters.  
More will they speak, for now I am bent to know.  
By the worst means, the worst. For my own good  
All causes shall give way. I have stepped  
In blood so deep that, should I wade no more,  
Returning were as tedious as going through.  
Strange thought I have in head, that will to hand,  
Which must be acted ere they may be scanned.

LADY MACBETH

You lack sleep.

MACBETH

Come, let's go to sleep. My strange and self-abuse  
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.  
We are yet but young in evil deeds.

(Exeunt)
