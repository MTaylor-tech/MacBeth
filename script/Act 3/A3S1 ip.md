ACT \[3\]

SCENE \[1\]

(Enter BANQUO)

BANQUO

You have it now: King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,  
As the weird women promised, and I fear  
You played most foully for it. Yet it was said  
It should not stand in your posterity,  
But that myself should be the root and father  
Of many kings, It there come truth from them--  
As upon you, MacBeth, their speeches shine--  
Why, by the verities on you made good,  
May they not be my oracles as well  
And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.

(Trumpets sound. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, LORDS, LADIES, and attendants.)

MACBETH

Here's our guest of honor.

LADY MACBETH

If he had been forgotten, it would have been a gap in our great feast and unbecoming.

MACBETH

Tonight we hold a ceremonial supper, sir, and I request your presence.

BANQUO

As Your Highness commands.
