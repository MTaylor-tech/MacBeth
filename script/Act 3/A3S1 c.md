ACT \[3\]

SCENE \[1\]

(Enter BANQUO)

BANQUO

You have it now: King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,  
As the weird women promised, and I fear  
You played most foully for it. Yet it was said  
It should not stand in your posterity,  
But that myself should be the root and father  
Of many kings, If there come truth from them--  
As upon you, MacBeth, their speeches shine--  
Why, by the prophecies on you made good,  
May they not be my oracles as well  
And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.

(Trumpets sound. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, LORDS, LADIES, and attendants.)

MACBETH

Here's our guest of honor.

LADY MACBETH

If he had been forgotten, it would have been a gap in our great feast and unbecoming.

MACBETH

Tonight we hold a ceremonial supper, sir, and I request your presence.

BANQUO

As Your Highness commands.

MACBETH

Are you riding this afternoon?

BANQUO

Yes, my lord.

MACBETH

I would have liked to have your advice in council today, but we'll hear from you tomorrow. Do you ride far?

BANQUO

Far enough, my lord, as will fill my time until supper, perhaps until nightfall.

MACBETH

Don't miss our feast.

BANQUO

My lord, I will not.

MACBETH

I hear my treacherous cousins, those princes, are hiding in England and Ireland, not confessing their cruel patricide, telling lies. But, of that, tomorrow, when we shall discuss all matters of state concerning us both. Adieu, till your return at night. Goes Fleance with you?

BANQUO

Yes, my lord, and it's time we go.

MACBETH

I wish you godspeed. Farewell.

(Exit BANQUO)

MACBETH

Let everyone be master of their time  
Till seven at night. To make society  
The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself  
Till suppertime alone. Till then, God be with you!

(Exeunt all except MACBETH and SERVANT)

MACBETH

(To SERVANT)

A word with you. Those men await my pleasure?

SERVANT

They do, my lord, outside the palace gate.

MACBETH

Bring them before me.

(Exit SERVANT)

MACBETH

To be king is nothing,

But to be safely king... Our fears in Banquo

Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature

Reigns that which would be feared. It's much he dares,

And to that dauntless temper of his mind

He has a wisdom that does guide his valor

To act in safety. There is none but he

Whose being I do fear, and under him

My genius is rebuked, as it is said

Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He scorned the sisters

When first they put the name of king upon me

And bade them speak to him. Then, prophet-like,

They hailed him father to a line of kings.

Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown

No son of mine succeeding. If it be so,

For Banquo’s issue have I filed my mind;

For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered;

Put rancors in the vessel of my peace

Only for them; and my eternal soul

Given to the common enemy of man,

To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!

Rather than that, bring fate into the list,

And champion me to the utterance.  
Who’s there?

(Enter SERVANT and two MURDERERS)

MACBETH

(To SERVANT)

Go to the door and stay there until I call.

(SERVANT exits)

MACBETH

Was it not yesterday we spoke together?

FIRST MURDERER

It was, your highness.

MACBETH

Well, then, have you considered what I said? Know that it was Banquo who held you in the dungeons, not I.

FIRST MURDERER

You made it known to us.

MACBETH

I did, and went further, which is now the point of this second meeting. Do you find yourselves so patient as to be ready to forgive him?

SECOND MURDERER

We are men, my lord.

MACBETH

Yes, in the catalog you go for men,  
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,  
Lap dogs, shepherds, and demi-wolves are listed  
All by the name of dogs. And so of men.  
But if you have a station in the file,  
Not in the worst rank of manhood, tell me,  
And I will put that business in your bosoms  
Whose execution takes your enemy off,  
and will grapple you to my heart and love.

SECOND MURDERER

I am one, my lord, who has been so beaten by the world that I care not for what I do.

FIRST MURDERER

And I another so weary with misfortune that I would set my life on any chance to mend it or be rid of it.

MACBETH

Both of you know Banquo was your enemy.

BOTH MURDERERS

True, my lord.

MACBETH

So is he mine, and in such bloody hatred  
That every minute of his being thrusts  
Against my heart and life. And though I could  
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight  
And bid it was my will, yet I must not,  
For certain friends that are both his and mine,  
Whose loves I may not drop, will wail his fall  
If I myself struck him down, and so it is,  
That I to your assistance do make love,  
Masking the business from the common eye  
For many weighty reasons.

SECOND MURDERER

We shall, my lord, perform what you command us.

FIRST MURDERER

Though our lives--

MACBETH

(Interupting)

Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour  
I will advise you where to hide yourselves.  
It must be done tonight. And with him--  
To leave no holes nor botches in the work--  
Fleance, his son, who keeps him company...  
His death is no less material to me  
Than is his father's. Resolve yourselves,  
I'll come to you soon.

BOTH MURDERERS

We are resolved, my lord.

(The MURDERERS exit)

MACBETH

It is concluded, Banquo, your soul's flight,  
If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.

(Exit)
