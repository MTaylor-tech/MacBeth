ACT \[3\]

SCENE \[2\]

(Enter LADY MACBETH and SERVANT)

LADY MACBETH

Has Banquo gone from court?

SERVANT

Yes, milady, but he returns tonight.

LADY MACBETH

Tell my husband I would talk to him for a few words.

SERVANT

Madam, I will.

(Exit SERVANT)

LADY MACBETH

Naught's had, all's spent,  
Where our desire is got without content.  
It's safer to be that which we destroy  
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.

(Enter MACBETH)

LADY MACBETH

How now, husband! Why do you keep alone?  
Things without all remedy  
Should be without regard. What's done is done.

MACBETH

Better be with the dead,

Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,

Than on the torture of the mind to lie

In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave.

After lifeâ€™s fitful fever he sleeps well.

Treason has done its worst; not steel nor poison,

Rebellion, invasion, nothing

Can touch him further.

LADY MACBETH

Come on, gentle my lord,  
Sleek o'er your rugged looks. Be bright and jovial  
Among our guests tonight.

MACBETH

So I shall, love.  
An so, I pray, will you. Let your attention  
Apply to Banquo; present him eminence,  
Both with eye and tongue. We are unsafe so we  
Must lave our honors in these flattering streams,  
And make our faces masks unto our hearts,  
Disguising what they are.

LADY MACBETH

You must stop this.

MACBETH

Oh, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!  
You know that Banquo and his Fleance live.

LADY MACBETH

But not forever can they stay alive.

MACBETH

There's comfort yet; they are assailable.  
Then you be cheerful. Ere the bat has flown,  
there shall be done a deed of dreadful note.

LADY MACBETH

What's to be done?

MACBETH

Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest wife,  
Till you applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,  
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,  
And with your bloody and invisible hand  
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond  
Which keeps me pale. Light thickens, and the crow  
Makes wing to the rooky wood.  
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;  
While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.  
You marvel at my words but hold you still,  
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.  
So, prithee, go with me.

(Exeunt)
