ACT \[3\]

SCENE \[5\]

(Enter the three WITCHES meeting HECATE)

BADB

Why, what's wrong, Hecate? You look angerly.

HECATE

Have I not reason,\[beldams\] as you are?  
Saucy and overbold. How did you dare  
To trade and traffic with MacBeth  
In riddles and affairs of death,  
And I, the mistress of your charms,  
The secret goddess of all harms,  
Was never called to bear my part,  
Or show the glory of our art?  
And, which is worse, all you have done  
Has been but for a wayward son,  
Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,  
Loves for his own ends, not for you.  
But make amends now. Get you gone,  
And at the pit of Acheron  
Meet me in the morning. There he  
Will come to know his destiny.  
Your cauldrons and your spells provide,  
Your charms and everything beside.  
I am for the air. This night I'll spend  
Unto a dismal and a fatal end.  
Great business must be wrought ere noon.  
Upon the corner of the moon  
There hangs a vaporous drop profound.  
I'll catch it ere it comes to the ground.  
And that distilled by magic sleights  
Will raise such artificial sprites  
As by the strength of their illusion  
Will draw him on to his confusion.  
He will spurn fate, score death, and bear  
His hopes above wisdom, grace andfear.  
And you all know, security  
Is mortals' greatest enemy.

(Music and a song offstage "Come Away")

HECATE

Hark! I am called. My little spirit, see,  
Sits in a foggy cloud and waits for me.

(Exit HECATE)

BADB

Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.

(Exeunt)
