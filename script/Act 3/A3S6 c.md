ACT \[3\]

SCENE \[6\]

(Enter ROSS and LENNOX)

LENNOX

Only I say  
Things have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan  
Was pitied by MacBeth. Granted, he was dead.  
And the valiant Banquo walked too late at night.  
It's believe he was killed by Fleance, for Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.  
Who cannot think how monstrous it was for Malcolm and for Donalbain to kill their gracious father? A heinous crime! How it did grieve MacBeth! Did he not in pious rage kill the two delinquents who were the slaves of drink? Was that not rightly done? Yes, and wisely, too, for it would have angered any heart alive to hear the men deny they'd done it. For that, I say, He has borne all things well. And I do think if he had Duncan's sons in his power, they would find out what it means to kill a father. So should Fleance. But enough of that! I hear MacDuff lives in disgrace for treasonous words and because he failed to appear at the tyrant's feast. Sir, can you tell me where he abides?

ROSS

The son of Duncan--from whom this tyrant holds the birthright--lives in the English court. There MacDuff has gone to ask King Edward to send Northumberland and General Siward, that by their help we may again prosper, free from those secret bloody knives. The report of this has so exasperated MacBeth that he prepares for some attempt of war.

LENNOX

Sent he word to MacDuff to return?

ROSS

He did, and with an absolute, "Sir no way,"  
The scowling messenger turned his back,  
As if to say, "You'll rue the day  
That you gave me this answer."

LENNOX

And that might well  
Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance  
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel  
Should fly to the court of England and give  
His message to MacDuff. That a swift blessing  
May soon return to this our suffering country  
Under a hand accursed.

ROSS

I'll send my prayers with him.

(Exeunt.)
