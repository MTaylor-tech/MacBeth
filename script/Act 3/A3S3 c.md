ACT \[3\]

SCENE \[3\]

(Enter three MURDERERS)

FIRST MURDERER

But who told you to join with us?

THIRD MURDERER

MacBeth.

SECOND MURDERER

Lay off of him, for he was given orders  
That were the same as ours.

FIRST MURDERER

Then stand with us.  
It's almost time and near approaches  
The subject of our watch.

THIRD MURDERER

There! I hear them now.

BANQUO

(offstage)

Give us a light there, ho!

SECOND MURDERER

It's him!

FIRST MURDERER

A light! A light!

THIRD MURDERER

That's him!

SECOND MURDERER

Stand to it!

(Enter BANQUO and FLEANCE with a light)

BANQUO

It will be rain tonight.

FIRST MURDERER

Let it come down!

(The MURDERERS attack BANQUO)

BANQUO

Oh treachery! Run good Fleance, run, run, run!  
You must avenge me!

(BANQUO dies. Exit FLEANCE.)

THIRD MURDERER

Who did strike out the light?

FIRST MURDERER

Should I not have?

THIRD MURDERER

There's only one. The son has fled.

SECOND MURDERER

We have failed in half of our affair.

FIRST MURDERER

Let's get going and report back to MacBeth.

(Exeunt.)
